# Work it out- the game
See also documentation at
https://goppeltm.github.io/WorkItOut-game/

## What is this?
"Work it out" is a tabletop game mainly meant for training purposes.
There are currently two versions of it:
The singleplayer mode focusses on micromanaging tasks, 
basically project management without the actual work.

The multiplayer mode focusses on team cooperation,
while demonstrating how conflicts within a team may arise.
This game and its feedback cycles were inspired by lessons from system theory, 
and systemic psychologic counseling.

## Why should I play this?
This game started from a discussion at work, 
where we wondered why so many software projects (and other projects) fail, 
even in seemingly healthy environments. 

Obviously, there are many possible answers, but this game focusses on two thesises:
1. Planning involves subtle aspects that defy human intuition
2. The common assumption that it is in the best interest of every team member
  if the project is a big success, is wrong. 

## Where to start?
If you want to play it, go to the github pages link above, and print out all gaming material.
If you are interested in how the game is being developed, take a look at the meta documentation
and scripts.
