## What is this?
Imagine a young team of developers which is practicing their first few development sprints.
It takes quite some time until everyone has found and settled in their role, and the team is working smoothly together like a well-oiled machine.

"Work it out" is a cooperative tabletop game mainly meant for training purposes. 
It tries to strip away the actual work, 
and concentrate on simulating the team interactions,
so you can practice team building in a very short time frame.
This game and its feedback cycles were inspired by lessons from system theory, and systemic psychotherapy.
