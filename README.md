# Work it out- the game
See also documentation at
https://goppeltm.github.io/WorkItOut-game/

## What is this?
"Work it out" is a tabletop game mainly meant for training purposes.
There are currently two versions of it:
The singleplayer mode focusses on micromanaging tasks, 
basically project management without the actual work.

The multiplayer mode focusses on team cooperation,
while demonstrating how conflicts within a team may arise.
This game and its feedback cycles were inspired by lessons from system theory, 
and systemic psychologic counseling.

## Where to start?
