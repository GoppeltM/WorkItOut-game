# L2 Rules: Co-Workers
This ruleset works exactly like L1, but with the following changes:

## Preparation
The first player starts with the "leader" marker.

## Hiring
Any team member that is hired (including the first player) gets two random goals.
Any team member HAS to be represented by a player.

## Goal
After 25 rounds, each player counts their points from both goals, and adds them. 
The player with the most points wins.

## Delegating
Between step 4 and 5, every player, clockwise, starting by the leader, 
may opt to delegate all his work chips for this round to any other player
that still has his own work chips. (i.e. delegating multiple times is forbidden)
For doing so, a sixth work chip is added to the pool until next round.

## Decision making
The player with the most work chips gets the "leader" marker.
If two players have the same amount of work chips, the "leader" marker remains
at his current owner.
He may decide any remaining steps until next delegation
(i.e. choosing a request stack, rejecting, and hiring). Whoever still has work chips,
still assigns 0-max of his own chips to work.
