# L2 Rules: Co-Workers
This ruleset works exactly like L1, but with the following changes:

## Preparation
The first player starts with the "leader" marker.

## Hiring
Any team member that is hired (including the first player) gets two random goals.
Any team member HAS to be represented by a player.

## Goal
After 25 rounds, each player counts their points from both goals, and adds them. 
The player with the most points wins.

## Delegating
Between step 4 and 5, every player may opt to delegate 
all his work chips for this round to any other player
that still has his own work chips. (i.e. delegating multiple times is forbidden)
For doing so, one time unit is added from global pot to project pot.

## Decision making
The player with the most work chips gets the decision marker.
If two players have the same amount of work chips, the decision marker remains
at his current owner.
He may decide any remaining steps until next delegation
(i.e. choosing a request stack, rejecting, and hiring). Whoever still has work chips,
still assigns his own chips to work.
