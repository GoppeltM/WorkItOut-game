# L2 Rules: Co-Workers
This ruleset works exactly like L1, but with the following changes:

## Preparation
The first player starts with the "leader" marker, and two random goals

## Goal
After 25 rounds, each player counts their points from both goals, and adds them. 
The player with the most points wins.

## Step 1: Delegating
Every player, starting with the player left to the leader, clockwise,
may opt to delegate all his work chips for this round to any other player
that still has his own work chips.
For doing so, a sixth work chip is added to the pool until next round.
Delegation rounds are repeated, and stop, if it is the leader's turn again, 
and no player has delegated any chips.

## Step 2: Nominating leader
The player with the most work chips gets the "leader" marker 
and an old leader marker.
If two players have the same amount of work chips, the "leader" marker remains
at his current owner.
He may decide any remaining steps until next delegation, except...

## Step 5: Assigning work
Whoever still has work chips, still assigns 0-max of his own chips to work.
Work is assigned starting with the player left to the leader, 
clockwise, ending with the leader

## Step 11: Hiring
Any team member that is hired draws 
two random goals from a set of all 6. 
Each player should be aware what kind of goals there are.
Any team member HAS to be represented by a player.
