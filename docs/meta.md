# Meta thoughts about gameplay
This page is meant as a guidance how to develop the game. It is especially meant to help avoiding pitfalls.

* Do __NOT__ predefine roles. The only fix role is the customer, because we need at least some driving force for the game. All other roles should be created by the players as a result of the system, not vice versa
* __DO__ think in relations and interactions instead of discrete states
* __DO__ use only one resource (Time). 
* __DO__ keep other scenarios in mind, and design for openness. A development team is just one special team. It might be interesting to apply the same ruleset to slightly different working environments
* Do __NOT__ use extensive texts. Not only to reduce translation effort, but to keep the concept as abstract as possible

## Why time?
Additional resources like money, action points make the game more complicated, 
probably without adding any value to key game mechanics. 
Also, time is much more intuitive than abstract values.

## Why hurry?
In reality, you cannot wait forever to fulfill a request. Either your customer gets unsatisfied,
or the request loses significance. Working for a very long time on a single request with little to no effort
will probably not pay off. Finishing fast is a value of its own.
## Aging cost
Balancing aging cost vs. effort is the key, not necessarily gain. Small jobs with little effort and very high aging cost are still simple, because you can rush through them with one single big effort

## Communication cost
Big teams seem to struggle more than small teams, but why exactly? Communication channels add up
exponentially, unless teams are able to minimize their interdependencies somehow.

# Player moves
Each action should have immediate or longterm consequences. Balancing those is part of the game.

## Hire
Personal costs are probably the highest cost factor in most modern software projects, therefore
increasing a project size should be hurtful for the player. To make this decision even more thoughtful, 
firing is not an option.

## Accept request
Accepting a request is a bet on your future: if you can fulfill it, your customer will be happy and pay you well.
However, if you fail a request, the customer starts to distrust you. Also, taking too long to fulfill
a request will take a toll, too, because the customer's needs will probably change over time.

## Assign work
On the one hand, a team member without a task is a wasted team member. 
A task without assignment will lose its value. However, letting your team jump between multiple tasks will
lower efficiency due to context switches.
