First few rounds showed that expenses for cancelling projects is immense.
If you are unlucky, you will run out of time before fulfilling a single request.
Also, many requests are almost impossible to do alone, therefore you need a second
team member very soon.

Therefore, initial project pot was elevated from 30 to 50, which made it much more likely
to fulfill a few requests (if you do everything right).

Also, jobs with zero aging turned out as kind of a joker. They are like free money: 
you can keep them until you need to fill up your project pot, and then spend a little work
on them.
Most interestingly, this means that requests that do not age will probably stack up.
Is this true in reality as well? Is missing time pressure the main cause of many parallel
unfulfilled tasks?

Time for each round is actually really short. With a little practice, you can play a single round
within two minutes or so, at least at the beginning. This is a good sign, this means that 30 rounds
or so are feasible. Calculating costs with the 6-based chips were usually very straight-forward.
Still, far from being an easy game. There were times where deciding which (or any) stack
should be taken was really difficult.
To me, it seems that in most cases with just one or two team members, choosing the stack with
two cards is most beneficial: if the top card is bad, you can cancel it, and with a little luck
the card below will be beneficial. Three cards is way too much risk, and one card often won't fit.
