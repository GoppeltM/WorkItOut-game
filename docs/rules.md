# Participants

## The Customer
The customer is played by the game leader, and has an unlimited amount of requests.

## Project leader
The first player is designated as project leader, and may perform (or delegate) any game move

# Game elements

## Request stack
The stack has five slots. The first slot has one request card, the second two, etc. .
The card at the top is placed with its face upside.

## The project's time pot
The project starts with a limited amount of time.

## Player stones
Each player receives 5 player stones as soon as he/she is hired.
The project leader starts immediately with 5 Stones.

# Round
Each round is a sequence of these steps:
1. The request stack is restocked
2. For each different player stone on each request, remove one time unit from the time pot.
   I.e. multiple stones from the same player still costs only one unit.
3. For each player stone on each request, remove one time unit from the request effort stack.
4. reset each player stone back to each player.
   For each resetted stone, remove one time unit from the time pot.
5. For each active request, remove as many time units 
   from the time pot as described on the request.
6. For each request that has an empty effort stack, add the request reward to the time pot,
   and remove the request from the game.
7. Let the players perform their moves. Once all moves are done, a new round starts.
