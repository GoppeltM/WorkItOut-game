# Participants

## The Customer
The customer is played by the game leader, and has an unlimited amount of requests.

## Project leader
The first player is designated as project leader, and may perform (or delegate) any game move

# Game elements

## Request stack
The stack has five slots. The first slot has one request card, the second two, etc. .
The card at the top is placed with its face upside.

## The project's time pot
The project starts with a limited amount of time.

## Player stones
Each player receives 5 player stones as soon as he/she is hired.
The project leader starts immediately with 5 Stones.

# Round
Each round is a sequence of these steps:
1. The request stack is restocked
1. For each active request, add as many time units 
   to the effort stack as described on the request (aging cost).
1. For each different player stone on each request, add one time unit to the effort stack.
   Multiple stones from the same player still cost only one unit. (Communication / Multitasking effort)
1. reset each player stone back to each player.
   For each resetted stone, remove one time unit from the time pot (i.e. paying off work time).
1. For each request that has an empty effort stack, add the request reward to the time pot,
   and remove the request from the game.
1. Let the players perform their moves. Once all moves are done, a new round starts.

# Moves

## Hire
The project leader may add any number of team members. 
Each team member costs 10 time units of initial training.
Each team member gets his 5 player stones.

## Accept request
The project leader may draw one of the five request stack slots.
All cards from the stack are layed out, and as many time units are stacked on each effort field
as visible on the card

## Reject request
The project leader may reject one or more of the accepted cards, 
but has to pay cancellation costs immediately. Cancellation costs are 20% (floored) of possible gain (NOT effort)

## Assign work
Allows to finish one or more tasks, but spreading work will add additional costs
