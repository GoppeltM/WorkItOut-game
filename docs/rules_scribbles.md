This page contains rules that may not make it into the final game

__Planning capacities__
A player may not deal more than 10 player stones. 
Players that are not involved in planning may receive a time bonus
Planning multiple players may cost communication cost (making it more feasible to delegate)
Requests may be traded, but must stay covered

__Specializations__
Certain requests may require specializations (red, blue, green, yellow). 
Only members with proper specialization may add stones to them. 
To specialize, you have to spend 5 time units in one round to get the specialization marker.
Managing player stones (i.e. project leader) may require a specialization.

__Interactions__
How to enforce cooperation? Project leader may get elected, boycotted or vetoed.
* anonymous vote with (limited?) voting stones
How to enforce delegation?
* Limit the amount of actions a single person can decide
* Give buffs or bonusses to people who delegate

__Personal Traits__
Each team member may have a secret goal, which adds up to his points, 
or makes him lose the game if he/she does not fulfill it. For example:
* Lone wolf: finish at least two requests on your own
* Collector: your team must have had accepted at least 10 requests until the end
* Jack of all trades: you have been involved in at least 5 requests
* Unionist: your team contains at least 7 members

__Multitasking costs__
Splitting between multiple requests should get special penalties
