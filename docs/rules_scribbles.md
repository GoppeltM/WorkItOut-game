This page contains rules that may not make it into the final game

__Planning capacities__
A player may not deal more than 10 player stones. 
Players that are not involved in planning may receive a time bonus
Planning multiple players may cost communication cost (making it more feasible to delegate)

__Specializations__
Certain requests may require specializations (red, blue, green, yellow). 
Only members with proper specialization may add stones to them. 
To specialize, you have to spend 5 time units in one round to get the specialization marker.

__Personal Traits__
Each team member may have a secret goal, which adds up to his points. For example:
* Lone wolf: bonus points for requests you fulfill on your own
* Collector: bonus points for every request that is accepted (even if it is not closed)
* Jack of all trades: bonus points for every request you were involved in
* Social worker: bonus points for every additional team member

__Multitasking costs__
Splitting between multiple requests should get special penalties
