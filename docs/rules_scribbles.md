This page contains rules that may not make it into the final game

## Planning capacities
A player may not deal more than 10 player stones. 
Players that are not involved in planning may receive a time bonus
Planning multiple players may cost communication cost (making it more feasible to delegate)
Requests may be traded, but must stay covered

## Specializations
Certain requests may require specializations (red, blue, green, yellow). 
Only members with proper specialization may add stones to them. 
To specialize, you have to spend 5 time units in one round to get the specialization marker.
Managing player stones (i.e. project leader) may require a specialization.

## Interactions
How to enforce cooperation? Project leader may get elected, boycotted or vetoed. 
* anonymous vote with (limited?) voting stones
How to enforce delegation?
* player with the most cards available decides about requests and hiring
* Limit the amount of actions a single person can decide
* Give buffs or bonusses to people who delegate their markers to another person, e.g. :
for every 10 chips you can collect you get 1 more. Everyone can decide for his own markers

## Personal Agendas
Each player may have two goals, so he may adopt his strategy, 
depending on how other team members behave

### Moving from Cooperative to competitive
Change the game goal from total score to personal scores. 
Create goals that partially require cooperation, and partially create conflicts. Scoring points:
* work done
* specializations earned
* personal agendas fulfilled
* work delegated
* request fulfilled

### Goals

Each team member may have a secret goal, which adds up to his points, 
or makes him lose the game if he/she does not fulfill it. For example:
* Lone wolf: finish at least two requests on your own
* Collector: your team must have had accepted at least 10 requests until the end
* Jack of all trades: you have been involved in at least 5 requests
* Unionist: your team contains at least 7 members

Or, to make it more competitive, earn points for each goal, and balance them carefully.
Goals can be divided into:
* Strive for bigger/less output
* Strive for bigger/smaller teams
* Strive for more/less efficiency
* Strive for more/less accepted requests
* Strive for more/less cancelled requests
* Strive for more/less finished requests
Possible goals:
* Boni hunter: earn 1/10th of all collected gain
* : earn 1/5th of 500 - collected gain
* Busy bee: earn one point for each accepted request
* Slacker: earn one point for 20 - accepted requests
* gate keeper: earn two points for each cancelled request
* perfectionist: earn 20 - n cancelled requests points
* Unionist: earn two points for each player that got hired
* : earn two points for 10 - hired players
* Money maker: earn 1/5th of the final project pot



## Multitasking costs
Splitting between multiple requests should get special penalties

# Reverse gamemode (King of the hill)
Hiring is impossible. Instead of building up your team, you could start with a full team, 
and eliminate one after another after five rounds. 
Elimination is created through simple majority vote. 
This guarantees that all players are at least involved part of the time.
